Exercise 1:

From the following header extract:
1. Extract the title
2. Extract the introduction
3. Extract the author
4. Extract the photographer

*Hint*: Google something called repr and check what `print(repr(header))`
tells you.

#Using the hint:
#Uncomment the following line to see the output of repr(header)

#print(repr(header))

#Splitting and saving to a list.
header_list = header.split('\n')

#Removing extra white spaces in each element of our list.
for i in range(len(header_list)):
    header_list[i] = header_list[i].strip()

#Removing empty ('') elements.
header_list = list(filter(lambda item: item!='' , header_list))  

#Getting title and introduction.
title = header_list[0]
intro = header_list[1]

#Getting author and photographer.
#Here we strip out the part we don't want.
author = header_list[2].strip('By ')
photographer = header_list[3].strip('Photograph by ')

#Print information required
print('Title       : ', title)
print('Introduction: ', intro)
print('Author      : ', author)
print('Photographer: ', photographer)

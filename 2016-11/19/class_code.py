    "Does the Washington Post fact checking hold up over time?"

    We're going to be looking at one of looking at the data sources for
    the WP's Fact Checker story: "Giulianiâ€™s claim the White House invited
    Al Sharpton up to 85 times" and see if we can basically recreate their
    process for 2015 and 2016. Does their fact-checker hold up over time?
